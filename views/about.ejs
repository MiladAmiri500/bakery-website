                                <h2>From a Single Spark of Passion...</h2>
                                <p class="text-lead">Ayoob Bakery Australia wasn't born from a business plan. It was
                                    born from a memory: the smell of fresh bread in a grandmother's kitchen, the warmth
                                    of a shared pastry, the simple joy of a perfect cookie.</p>
                                <p>Our founder, Ayoob, spent years perfecting his craft, traveling and learning from
                                    artisan bakers before returning home with a single mission: to create a community
                                    hub where quality is never compromised, and every customer feels like family. In
                                    2015, he opened our doors, and the ovens haven't cooled since.</p>

                                    <p>We believe great baking starts with great ingredients. We source local, organic
                                        flour, farm-fresh eggs, and real butter. No shortcuts, no compromises.</p>

                                        meticulous hand-lamination for our pastries. You can taste the difference.</p>
